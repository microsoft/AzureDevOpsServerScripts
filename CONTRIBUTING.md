# Contributing

Contributions are not expected, we'd prefer you open an issue and let us make the change.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

## <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.

Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:


\*\*Overview of the Issue\*\* - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
\*\*Version\*\* - what version and edition of Azure DevOps and SQL Server is affected (e.g. ADO Sever 2019.1.1 SQL Server EE 2019)
\*\*Motivation for or Use Case\*\* - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
\*\*Reproduce the Error\*\* - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of steps
\*\*Related Issues\*\* - has a similar issue been reported before?
\*\*Suggest a Fix\*\* - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be causing the problem (line of code or commit)


You can file new issues by providing the above information at the corresponding repository's issues link:
